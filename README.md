# pick-place-robot-arm
A robot arm code for picking and placing a test cylinder in chemistry laboratory using ROS
I got motivated to do this project when I was doing my intership at Fincha Sugar Factory.

There the operators working at quality control deal everyday with 98% concentrated Sulfuric Acid(H2SO4). Working with this acid is very dangerous since it is very 
strong acid and so that they get their lungs ill overtime and also their nails. As I saw this I thought of a robot arm that can do the experiment by itself.

The experiment is done every 30 minutes and the procedure is as follows: 1. take water samples from boiler 2. pour it to test cylinder 3. pour sulfuric acid and other 2 chemicals to the test cylinder. 4. shake it and wait for a minute and see if if it has a color change.
